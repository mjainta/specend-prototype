# SpecEnd prototype

To setup Vue.js I have followed this tutorial: https://dev.to/37shadesofgrey/setting-up-vue-in-laravel-8-580m
- I have used yarn instead of npm!

To run the app, do:
```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up
# Switch to other tab
yarn run hot
# Open http://localhost  -> http, not https!
```
